# Kappa

A Fabric mod that enables OptiFine's capes, and also shows your own name tag in third person.
Forked from dragonostic/of-capes, but targeting snapshots. Licensed under LGPL 2.1. Not my choice, curse you, rms!
Updated by Hibiii.

Usually Fabric mods are compatible between versions, but sometimes, like in the 1.17 snapshots, Minecraft itself breaks the mods.
I will test my mod against the latest snapshot, because I like playing with my OptiFine cape, so if my mod is broken, I will update it.
When a version of Kappa is compatible with the newest snapshot, I will not rerelease it, but I'll certify it for working in said snapshot.
You will know you when to update the mod when it's broken in the latest snapshot.

Yes, OptiFine's cape breaks Minecraft's commercial usage guidelines, but I already had it for lots longer. I consider it part of my skin.
